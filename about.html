      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2020, VAT (View, Adopt, Take) has been on a mission to connect people with their perfect companions. 
        What started as a dream to help both people and animals find joy, quickly grew into a growing community dedicated to spreading love. 
        Our initial focus was on popular breeds such as <strong>Labradors</strong>, <strong>Golden Retrievers</strong>, <strong>German Shepherds</strong>, and <strong>Pitbulls</strong> for dogs, and <strong>Orange Tabby</strong>, <strong>Gray Tabby</strong>, <strong>Ragdoll</strong>, and <strong>British Shorthair</strong> for cats. 
        But our dream didnâ€™t stop there â€“ today, we offer a much wider range of breeds and more pets for adoption!

    <section class="journey">
      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Our story started as a dream in 2018 with our three founding members â€“ <strong>Anirudh</strong>, <strong>Teja</strong>, and <strong>Vinay</strong>. The idea was simple: make the process of adopting pets easier and help more families find their perfect companion. It wasn't always easy, but with determination, teamwork, and a lot of passion, VAT became a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2019, we had already started contacting various NGOs, learning how they helped animals find homes. Our next step was to create a platform of our own that would make it easier for people to find and adopt pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came a turning point â€“ in 2020, <strong>Sai</strong> became our sponsor, giving VAT the much-needed financial support to expand and reach even more people. With his help, we were able to scale up the platform, improve our services, and help even more animals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, <strong>Nikesh</strong>, the popular film star, joined hands with us after his blockbuster movie, "Zombie Rush," became a huge success. Not only did he invest in VAT, but he also became our official brand ambassador, bringing even more attention to our cause.

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        As we move into the future, we plan to expand our reach, offering more services for people who want to adopt pets. We want to make the process as easy and stress-free as possible. Together, with our dedicated team and our loyal partners, VAT is growing and changing, one loving adoption at a time.
