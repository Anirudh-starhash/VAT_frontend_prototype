            <strong>Mrs. Carol</strong> adopted this dog from us 2 years ago. She was all alone during the lockdown and felt
            that she found a perfect companion in the dog to regulate her stress and anxiety during the hard times.

            <strong>Mr. Ragunath</strong>, a retired army officer, adopted this dog 5 years ago. He expressed that this dog
            was a good companion and made up for the boredom of him as he was very playful and sometimes even naughty
            like a grandchild.
